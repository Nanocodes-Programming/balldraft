    <p><u>3.3</u> We may use your information to communicate with you about:</p>
    <p class="indented-item"><u>3.3.1</u> our products and services in which you may be interested provided that you

    </p>
    <p><u>3.4</u> We also use cookies, clear gifs, log file information, and mobile app information such as device
        identifiers for purposes such as (a) remembering information so that you will not have to re-enter it during
        your visit or the next time you visit our Service; (b) providing custom, personalized content and information;
        (c) monitoring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitoring aggregate metrics such as total
        number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) tracking your entries, submissions, and status in promotions,
        sweepstakes, and contests. You can learn more about how these technologies are used in the Section below, Third
        Party Advertising and Analytics.</p>
    <p><u>3.5</u> We may anonymize, de-identify, or aggregate your information for any legitimate business purposes,
        including for reporting and research, or advertising. Such anonymized and/or aggregated data does not personally
        identify you. Sometimes, this information may be used to target more relevant content or offers to you across
        different devices – for instance, we may provide you with offers and content on your mobile device, based on
        your web-based activity.</p>
    <p><u>3.6</u> We will retain personal information as long as necessary to fulfill these purposes unless the law
        requires us to keep it for a longer period of time. To provide security and business continuity for the
        activities described here, we make backups of certain data, which we may retain for longer than the original
        data.</p>

    <h2>5. Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data</h2>

        targeting advertising by going to www.aboutads.info, and you may learn more about this type of advertising in
        the below Section titled “Third Party Advertising and Analytics.” You may opt out of tracking for mobile

        attempt to answer your questions and satisfy your concerns in a timely and complete manner.</p>
    <h2>7. Advertising And Analytics</h2>
    <p><u>7.1</u> We work with a number of companies that assist in marketing our services to you on third party
        websites. These companies may collect information about online activities conducted on a particular computer,
        browser or device over time and across third-party websites or online services for the purpose of delivering
        advertising that is likely to be of greater interest to you, including about our Services, on sites and apps of
        third parties. Also, certain ads appearing on our Services are delivered by our advertising partners. Our
        advertising partners may use cookies and other similar technologies, often in conjunction with unique
        (anonymous) cookie identifiers, to collect data about your activities and interests, including the technologies
        described above. Some of these partners may use mobile device identifiers, such as Apple IDFAs and
        Google/Android Advertising IDs. Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer or device each
        time they send you an online or mobile advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information
        about where you, or others who are using your computer or device, saw their advertisements and measure your
        interaction with each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of
        increased interest to you, both on our Services and elsewhere online. Just as these technologies may be used to
        target ads on our websites and apps, we, or our advertising partners, may use these same technologies and data
        points (e.g., mobile identifiers, cookie identifiers, location-based data), through our Services or through other
        services, to target advertising (for ourselves or other companies) on other sites or mobile apps. Sometimes,
        these identifiers may be derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email
        address. We may use this information to measure the performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to
        evaluate which ads or content our users prefer, or which are most effective. In addition, sometimes we or an
        advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across different devices.</p>
    <p><u>7.2</u> To learn more and to opt out of the collection of data on our website by third parties (including
        those described above) for interest-based advertising purposes, please visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>. Note that because this opt out
        method may be cookie-based, you will need to opt out again if you update or change your browser, or delete your
        cookies. You can also control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device with the AppChoices app,
        available for iOS and Android. Note that opting out will not affect the quantity of ads you see online but
        likely will cause the ads to be less relevant to you.</p>
    <p><u>7.3</u> We also that we also work with third-party analytics companies to collect data on our Service through
        cookies and other automated means. In some cases, the third parties mentioned in this section may maintain the
        information they collect in personally identifiable form. These services allow us to view a variety of reports
        about how visitors interact with the Services so we can improve our website and understand how people find and
        navigate it.</p>
    <h2>8. Information Security</h2>
    <p><u>8.1</u> We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security
        technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
        disclosure.</p>
    <p><u>8.2</u> Whilst neither we, nor any other organization, can guarantee the security of information processed
        online, we do have appropriate security measures in place to protect your personal information. For example, we
        store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in
        facilities to which access is limited.</p>
    <p><u>8.3</u> To further protect your privacy and security, we reserve the right to take reasonable steps (such as
        requesting your password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections.</p>
    <p><u>8.4</u> Additionally, you should ensure your password is kept secret at all times. You will be responsible for
        maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information.</p>

    <p><b>Categories of personal information we collect.</b> Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the
        specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about users. Under the CCPA, we are also required to
        provide you with the “categories” of personal information we collect. The categories we may collect are:

        inference data about you; and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.</p>

        personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request:</p>

            sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;

    <p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please
        note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may
        include if we need to keep processing your information or to comply with a legal obligation. We will let you
        know where this is the case or if certain rights don’t apply in your country or state of residence. We also will
        take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which might include, at a minimum,
        depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making,
        verifying your name, email address, and date of birth. You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent
        to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the
        authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such request or a power of attorney. We may also follow
        up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.</p>

        allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies IP address and/ or browsing behavior, to
